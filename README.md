# PolyChip8

PolyChip8 is a [Chip-8 Interpreter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CHIP-8) Written in C#

I decided to write this interpreter in order to learn about emulation.

The interpreter runs and passes the test_opcodes.ch8.

There are issues with timing and graphics.

PolyChip8 has a debug mode which shows the running disassembled ROM along with the registers and RAM.
